About Me
________________________________________
Hi, I’m Armaan Bhandari, a Mechanical Engineer, Problem Solver, and Tech Enthusiast based in Dehradun, India. I’m passionate about understanding the core principles of mechanical engineering and applying them to solve real-world problems. I am particularly keen on integrating advanced technologies into classical mechanical engineering to give it a new edge, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field.
Currently, I’m a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT BHU), Varanasi — an institution with a legacy that stretches back before India’s independence. And I am driven to make a meaningful impact through innovation and problem-solving in the world of engineering.
